All work must have an __associated Issue__, in order to be able to trace it back.

1. Initialize git-flow:
```sh
bash .bin/git_gitflow.sh init
```

2. Start a new feature, where X is the Issue #:
```sh
git flow feature start Issue-X
```

3. Work in your solution 👩‍💻✏️😄

4. Finish the feature:
```sh
git flow feature finish Issue-X
```

5. Pull 'develop' changes:
```sh
git pull develop
```

6. Push your changes:
```sh
git pull develop
```
